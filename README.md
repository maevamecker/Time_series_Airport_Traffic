# Time_series_Airport_Traffic

The objective of this project is to apply Box-Jenkins methodology to forecast Sydney airport traffic time series.

The procedure used in this project was:
- the description of the time series (trend, seasonality, random component)
- study of stationarity
- transformation from non-stationary to stationary through log transformation, first order difference, difference of lag 12
- Box-Jenkins methodology to build a model
- residual diagnostic
- quality of the fit
